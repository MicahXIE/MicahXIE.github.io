## Background

I am very glad to help our team to organise and setup this `Tech Friday` event. The target of 
`Tech Friday` is to help team member to continue to learn new things and share to others so that
we can get some cool ideas to create interesting tools and also understand the technology in deep.
I am very glad to be the first speaker and I hope I can learn more new things and do more sharings
this year.
