like them too.

Tang Poem:

         问刘十九
         唐-白居易

    绿蚁新醅酒，红泥小火炉。

    晚来天欲雪，能饮一杯无？



The Gift of the Magi (O. Henry):

    One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. She had put it aside, 
    one cent and then another and then another, in her careful buying of 
    meat and other food.

    It was a gold watch chain, very simply made. Its value was in its 
    rich and pure material. Because it was so plain and simple, you knew 
    that it was very valuable. All good things are like this.

    Eight dollars a week or a million dollars a year—how different are they? 
    Someone may give you an answer, but it will be wrong. The magi brought 
    valuable gifts, but that was not among them.

    The magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—
    who brought gifts to the newborn Christ-child. They were the first to
    give Christmas gifts. Being wise, their gifts were doubtless wise ones.
    And here I have told you the story of two children who were not wise. 
    Each sold the most valuable thing he owned in order to buy a gift for 
    the other. But let me speak a last word to the wise of these days: Of all 
    who give gifts, these two were the most wise. Of all who give and receive 
    gifts, such as they are the most wise. Everywhere they are the wise ones. 
    They are the magi.
