## Background

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a very strong Computer Vision Library using in industry. OpenCV is originally written in C++ but it also can be used by Python, JAVA and MATLAB. 
Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform.

Below two articles are very good reference for setting up opencv in Mac for c++ development. The first one compiles the source code to install the library. The second one uses homebrew to install 
the opencv. Really thanks for sharing your knowledge! In this article, I will focus on the issues
I hit when I install the libraries.
